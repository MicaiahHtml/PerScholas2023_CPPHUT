By Micaiah Vinson - PERSCHOLAS 2023 MOD 3 FINAL 

## Introduction

CPPHUT.com is a script-sharing website where you can compile your own scripts, create/save/edit/delete scripts in your script hut, search for other huts, and clone other people's scripts. It is an extensive demonstration of back-end development with full-stack understanding, showcasing database management with many efficient Mongoose operations.
